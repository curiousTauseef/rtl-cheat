## Silicon material

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_melting> Major advance that allowed for the production of pure germanium, and led to the discovery of the semi-conductor.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_%28electronics%29> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czochralski_process> Hard because you need 0.1 degree temperature control at 1000 degrees: <https://youtu.be/ihkRwArnc1k?t=961>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallite>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor> the first transistor type. Hard to make, and too unstable. This was Shockley's major advance, the junction transistor: <https://youtu.be/ihkRwArnc1k?t=1363>

Gordon Teal from Texas Instruments made a modification of Czochralski by adding PN impurities at the right time to form a PNP sandwitch, making a fully solid state transistor: <https://youtu.be/ihkRwArnc1k?t=1429> I think this makes a <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy-junction_transistor> were another attempt <https://youtu.be/ihkRwArnc1k?t=1678> using indium.

<https://youtu.be/uGRNXmWng3M?t=278> mentions that germanium was bad because it was not stable to temperature TODO why.

People wanted to use silicon because it was much more abundant, but it was hard because it was too reactive. The oxide layer was discovered by chance when a valve broke at bell labs.

Purified silicon rods (poly): <https://youtu.be/uGRNXmWng3M?t=497> Just like the wiki photo: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrystalline_silicon#/media/File:Leo_Tie_Rodsedit.jpg>

Japanese made advances in silicon purification: <https://youtu.be/uGRNXmWng3M?t=644> Consistent with: <http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2011/03/21/japan-quake-knocked-out-25-of-global-silicon-wafer-production/#56814ec4553e>

The mesa transistor was the first main product of Fairchild: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_transistor#Mesa_transistor> Good schematic: <https://youtu.be/uGRNXmWng3M?t=914> That was unstable after sales, so they made the planar transistor.

## History

Americans gave factory tours to Japanese scientists: <https://youtu.be/ihkRwArnc1k?t=1873> which made detailed notes and sent them back to Japan, where they were treated as highly confidential.

<https://youtu.be/ihkRwArnc1k?t=2270> mentions that Sony's breakthrough was an Indium Phosphorus method, and that as in the US for TI, the initial explosive market were amplifiers in radios, which sold incredibly because they advanced portability to a new level.

<https://youtu.be/uGRNXmWng3M?t=1108> shows how the planar transistors are made quite well.

Noyce sold planar transistor license to Japan.

Agricultural spraying season reduced semi-conductor yields in the 1970s because no clean room: <https://youtu.be/ansXGewduN4?t=1227>

In order to make cheaper calculators, Japanese pioneered liquid crystal usage: <https://youtu.be/ansXGewduN4?t=2050>

### Jack Kilby

At Texas instruments, made some big step in 58. TODO what exactly. He went for germanium. Noyce went for Silicon and scored. Apparently independent.

Problem was called tyranny of numbers.

Made development during 2 weeks that other people had a mandatory vacation, but he was too new to get it.
